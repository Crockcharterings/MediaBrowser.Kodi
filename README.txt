Basic Movie functionality is working now.

To Install:
1. Download the GIT zip file(look to the right of this), placing it where is can be found by XBMC.
2. Install using "Install from zip file", which can be found in 
   Settings -right arrow-> Addons
or
   Settings -click-> Addons -> Install from Zip
   
3. Browse for the plugin zip file, select and install
4. Go into the plugin settings and turn auto discover off, specify your MB3 ip and port.

If all goes well, you will be able to browse your library and play movies (TV not working yet). 

NOTE: When first going into your library it will take a long time as it needs to cache all images locally right now.  Only an issue on first entry.

Please check the issues and add as needed.

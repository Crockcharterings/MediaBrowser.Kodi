Basic Movie functionality is working now.

If you want to play, download and install PleXBMC. 

Go into the plugin settings and turn auto discover off, specify your MB3 ip and port.
Replace default.py with the one in my repo.

If all goes well, you will be able to browse your library and play movies (TV not working yet). 

NOTE: When first going into your library it will take a long time as it needs to cache all images locally right now.  Only an issue on first entry.

Please check the issues and add as needed.
